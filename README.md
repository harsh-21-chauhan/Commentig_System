# Commenting System

This repository contains a simple commenting system built with a Python backend and HTML-based frontend. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate how user authentication and a basic comment workflow can be implemented together in a minimal web application.

## Overview
The system allows users to register, log in, and post comments once authenticated. It focuses on clarity and simplicity, making it easy to understand the flow between the frontend pages and backend logic. The project structure includes Python files handling authentication and comment operations, along with HTML templates for the user interface.

## Features
1. User registration and login
2. Authentication-based access for posting comments
3. Clean and minimal interface
4. Straightforward backend logic suitable for learning or extending
   
## Project Purpose
This project was created as a small full-stack demo, useful for understanding how authentication integrates with a commenting feature. It can be used as a reference or starting point for further development.
